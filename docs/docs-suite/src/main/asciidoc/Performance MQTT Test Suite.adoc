== Getting started
Now you have an opportunity to independently evaluate the performance of *IoTBroker.Cloud*.
Besides this test suite can be used to measure the performance of your own software.
The following instruction will explain how to run the performance tests by yourself.

== Prerequisites
The following programs should be installed before starting to clone the project:

* *JDK* (version 7+);

* *Eclipse*;

* *Maven*.

== Installation
First of all, you should clone https://github.com/mobius-software-ltd/mqtt-test-suite[Performance MQTT Test Suite].

Then you have to build the project. For this purpose, open the Performance Test Suite project in Eclipse, right-click *mqtt-test-suite* and go to _Maven / Update Project_.
Then you should again right-click *mqtt-test-suite* and go to _Run As / Maven clean_. Finally you should right-click *mqtt-test-suite* and go to _Run As / Maven install_.

Now you have the controller (in _mqtt-test-suite/controller/target_ folder) and the test runner (in _mqtt-test-suite/runner/target_ folder) jar files on your computer.
To make the work more convenient, create performance_test folder which will contain controller-jar-with-dependencies.jar and runner-jar-with-dependencies.jar.
Also you should add JSON files to this very performance_test folder and controller.params file (you can find it _mqtt-test-suite/controller_ folder).

== Test run
First you should open the terminal and `cd` to performance_test folder. You should start the controller by running the command which is given below (do not forget to indicate your path):

[source,bash]
----
java -Xmx2048m -Xms512m -jar controller.jar http://127.0.0.1:9998/ /home/username/performance_test/controller.params
----

Here is a brief explanation:

*Xmx2048m* – maximum memory allocation;

*Xms512m* – initial memory allocation;

*controller.jar* – controller which is inside the performance_test folder;

*http://192.168.1.1:9998/* - IP address and port of controller;

*/home/username/performance_test/controller.params* – path to controller.params file.

You should open the second terminal window and `cd` to performance_test folder. Now you can run the test by running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar test-runner.jar pipeline.json
----
The command mentioned above is an example of running the test scenario which is described in pipeline.json file.

Each JSON file contains different test scenarios. You can separately run each test scenario by indicating the name of a specific JSON file.
When the test is over you will get the report for each test scenario:

[source,bash]

Each test can be run in its current form.
Besides you can change the existing test scenarios or add the new ones.
The information given below will help you to get into these test requests.
